# Mini-Challenge 1 - High Performance Computing (hpc) HS23

## Containers, Communication Patterns/Frameworks and Performance Analysis

You have a client that continuously accumulates data and wants to process it further. To do this, the client wants to use the [Apache Kafka - Data Streaming Platform](https://kafka.apache.org/) in a first step. In a second step it will use a different communication pattern. The application runs distributed in different Docker containers. Define what kind of data your client has and what problem they want to solve with it. Describe the initial situation and the problem to be solved. Then implement your methods according to the tasks below. Write a short report and answer the questions of each of the 4 parts bellow. Include measurements/plots where meaningful.

[Use GitHubClassroom to work on this mini challenge](https://classroom.github.com/a/GJKnhHY_)

### Intro to Kafka using Docker containers

1. Set up Kafka locally on your computer by using the provided Docker Compose file or create your own setup. Command line:`docker-compose up -d`. 

    We start with a Docker compose template, which launches 5 containers:

    * broker-[x] - Kafka brokers
    * jupyter    - Jupyter environment for the connection to our Kafka cluster using notebooks
    * kafdrop    - web UI for browsing and monitoring Kafka clusters

2. Open the Jupyter notebook on your machine using: http://127.0.0.1:8888. Start to play around with sending and receiving messages. Use [Kafdrop]( https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop) to monitor/explore your cluster, topics, and messages. For example, start and stop individual brokers (e.g. via Docker Desktop) or change Kafka parameters such as the replication factor and watch how the cluster behaves via Kafdrop.

### Part 1: Kafka Cluster and Application Setup

1. Write two different data generator functions, which regularly send messages containing data. One generator should send messages at least every second (1Hz). Choose yourself which data is sent. The application of the data can be chosen freely, but choose a good mixture of a simple and a complex message. The data should be variable. The data generator can send simulated data or real data. Use suitable Kafka components and meaningful names of functions, variables etc. for the implementation. 

    Tips:
    * Use several notebooks such that you can start and stop the endless loops of data processing individually.
    * Use python programs rather than notebooks to automatically start the producers/consumers within their own containers.
    * After testing, stop the endless loop again otherwise your computer resources are unnecessarily occupied or at the limit.

2. Write a data processor and a data sink. The data processor should regularly read and process the data from the data generators. E.g., a calculation or a machine learning application on the retrieved data; a data enrichment; or the extraction of information from the message. Then the processor sends the data to a data sink. In the data sink the data is stored, e.g. in a CSV file. Use appropriate Kafka components and meaningful names of functions, variables, etc. for the implementation. 

3. Draw an overview of your application components including interfaces and data flows, for example using a component diagram. Answer the following questions and interpret your experiments or results: 
    
      * What are the tasks of the components?
      * Which interfaces do the components have?
      * Why did you decide to use these components? 
      * Are there any other design decisions you have made? Which requirements (e.g. libraries, hardware, ...) does a component have?
      * Which features of Kafka do you use and how does this correlate to the cluster / topic settings you choose?
      * Describe the Docker setup of your application.

#### Bonus 1
Use a more efficient serializers/deserializers than JSON for the messages.


### Part 2: Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Kafka

Change the scalability and stability of your Kafka cluster by changing the used resources. E.g.: add/remove brokers and play with parameters/config settings in the docker-compose file and the config of your topics, use orders of magnitude more producers/consumers. Perform 2-3 experiments with different configurations/scenarios and describe the results.

#### Bonus 2
Use some of Kafkas advanced features to enhance your application. E.g. to make it more fail-proof or to get more insights.


### Part 3: Communication Patterns

1. Rewrite your application of part 1 using another communication pattern. You can also use another communication framework, such as RabbitMQ and/or another underlying messaging protocol such as MQTT.
    
2. Pack your rewritten application into containers.

3. Answer the following questions and interpret your experiments or results: 
      * Which communication pattern is used by Kafka?
      * What is the difference compared to your chosen pattern?
      * What are the advantages and disadvantages of these patterns? 
      * How can you scale the two different approaches? What are ? Why? What are challenges to be considered?
      * What other 2-3 topologies/patterns do you know used for data processing? Describe the differences and use cases with at least one additional topology. 
      * Which pattern suits your chosen application best?

#### Bonus 3
Show how your container setup could be integrated into a container orchestration system (such as Kubernets) and how it would profit from this. Or show how you could replace some of the components with cloud-based offers and what changes/considerations come with this.


### Part 4: Performance Analysis and Evaluation of your Application

Profile your producers and consumers/data sinks. Describe the patterns and bottlenecks you see while executing different scenarios and workloads. Perform 2-3 experiments with different configurations.

  Some example experiments:
  
  * Measure the average time incl. standard deviation required by your producer/consumer loop over several runs.
  * Determine which call of your producer/consumer takes the most time. Which 3 methods are called the most or needed the most time and how much time?
  * Create a profile of your producer/consumer code in a xxxxx.prof file and create 1-2 visualizations of the profile (e.g. with [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/)).

#### Bonus 4
Mitigate or produce a bottleneck.


## Reflection

Write a reflection on the realization of the mini-challenge. What went well? Where did problems occur? Where did you need more time than planned? 
What would you do differently in the future? What would you change in the assignment? Give examples in each case.
